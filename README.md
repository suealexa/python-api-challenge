Observable Trends

1) Thanks to the Temperature graph we can definitively say that it's hotter near the equator.

2) The northern hemisphere is windier than the southern hemisphere.  The windiest cities in my graph are in Kansas. The cities bordering the
   Artic ocean are also windy.  In the southern hemisphere cities on islands are the windiest.
    
3) The humidity graph was the most surprising to me.  Overall the northern hemisphere is more humid than the south. I thought that cities 
   closer to the equator would be more humid but I found that the highest humidity was in cities bordering the Artic ocean in Russia, Greenland and Canada.  There is a pocket of cities that are very humid. When I looked into why I discovered that Artic humidity is the result of global warming and it will likely contribute to more humidity
