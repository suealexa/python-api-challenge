Observable Trends

1) Thanks to the Temperature graph we can definitively say that it's hotter near the equator.

2) The northern hemisphere is windier than the southern hemisphere.  The windiest cities are in Kansas but I couldn't find any expanation for
   why that is true. The cities bordering the Artic ocean are also windy.  In the southern hemisphere cities on islands are the windiest.
    
3) The humidity graph was the most surprising.  I expected cities near the equator to have the most humidity but that wasn't true.  Overall 
   the northern hemisphere is more humid than the south. The graph shows a cluster of the cities with the highest are near or on the Artic 
   ocean in Russia, Greenland and Canada.  When I looked into why I discovered that Artic humidity is the result of global warming.  It has
   been rising since the glaciers started melting. The warmer air on the ice does not generate humidity but when the warmer air meets the 
   water it does. The rising water vapor contributes to humid conditions and accelerates the rate of melting near the Artic circle.  The more 
   open surface water there is the more humidity there will be so it's a dangerous cycle.
